## FAQ

**Q: What is the difference between Breescape and the Bedsure Breescape Cooling Series?**

**A:** Breescape was established as part of Bedsure in 2024 and became an independent brand in 2025. Focused on delivering cutting-edge solutions for hot sleepers, Breescape integrates extensive research, rigorous testing, and continuous technological innovation.This led to the development of BlendTek™ technology, which powers all of our products, providing enhanced cooling for a better sleep.

**Q: How does BlendTek™ help reduce night sweats?**

**A:** BlendTek™ fabric is specifically designed to address night sweats with its moisture-wicking, breathable, and cooling properties. It efficiently absorbs excess moisture and enhances airflow, keeping you dry and comfortable throughout the night. Unlike traditional materials, BlendTek™ creates a temperature-regulating environment to minimize overheating, making it an excellent choice for those prone to night sweats, including individuals experiencing menopause.
